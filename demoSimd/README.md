========

This one holds a initially little demonstrator oriented to internal use only, to practice coding and debugging
intrinsics library.

At some point I was thinking about adding it to an actual project running image manipulation in the company
I worked at back then, and there are some code duplicated to that effect, but it did not make it there so
it is just an internal toying project and I can share it here.

Note this one compiles and run tests, but actually it is not cleaned closed, could be considered a WIP though
there has been some time now I could not work on it. I'll return to it because I enjoy it and has something
pending yet, namely coding the functions in assembler.
